          <p>Currently developing an end-to-end computer vision pipeline that transforms monocular camera recordings into actionable navigation data for autonomous robots. 
            The framework reconstructs 3D environments using Gaussian Splatting, extracts traversability maps, and performs optimal path planning. 
            The project integrates 3D reconstruction, perception, and planning into a unified system for real-world robotic navigation at Caltech’s Center for Autonomous Systems and Technologies (CAST).</p>

          <p>We developed a simulation framework for autonomous vehicle coordination at intersections using Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC).
            Each vehicle acted as an individual MPC agent communicating with neighbors to ensure safe and efficient traffic flow.
            The system was implemented in Python and SUMO via TraCI, integrating graph-based coordination and collision avoidance.
            Results showed improved intersection throughput and smoother trajectories compared to SUMO’s default control logic.
            The project demonstrated the potential of distributed control strategies for scalable autonomous traffic management.</p>

            We applied techniques such as data preprocessing, feature selection, dimensionality reduction (PCA), and model training using regression, classification, and neural networks. Model performance was optimized through cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

          <p>As part of the Human-Computer Interaction course at ETH Zurich, our team designed a finance tracking app tailored to the needs of young adults.
Through interviews, affinity mapping, and user studies, we identified key user needs such as manual expense entry, adaptive budgeting, and personalized visualization.
We iteratively developed and tested low-, mid-, and high-fidelity prototypes in Figma, focusing on intuitive interaction and accessibility.
The final A/B user study compared slider- vs. button-based budget adjustment, revealing that a minimal, button-driven design led to faster and more intuitive user interaction.</p>
